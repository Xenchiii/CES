# Background Task Processing

This service would handle tasks that shouldn't block the main web request/response cycle, such as:

*   Sending bulk emails (welcome messages, notifications, newsletters).
*   Generating large reports that take time.
*   Performing complex data processing triggered by user actions.

**Technology Choices:**

*   **Task Queue:** Celery (popular, feature-rich), RQ (simpler, Redis-based), Dramatiq.
*   **Message Broker:** Redis (often used with RQ/Celery), RabbitMQ (more robust).

**Example (Conceptual using Celery):**

```python
# tasks.py (in your Celery app)
from celery import Celery
import time

# Configure Celery (broker URL, etc.)
app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def send_welcome_email(user_email):
    print(f"Simulating sending welcome email to {user_email}...")
    time.sleep(5) # Simulate email sending delay
    print(f"Email sent to {user_email}")
    return {"status": "success", "email": user_email}

@app.task
def generate_large_report(report_params):
    print(f"Generating large report with params: {report_params}...")
    time.sleep(30) # Simulate long report generation
    report_data = {"report_id": "XYZ123", "data": "..."}
    print("Report generation complete.")
    # Optionally save report data somewhere or notify user
    return {"status": "success", "report_id": "XYZ123"}

# --- In your Flask/Django app (or Next.js API route calling this service) ---
# from .tasks import send_welcome_email, generate_large_report

# # When a user registers:
# send_welcome_email.delay(new_user_email)

# # When admin requests a large report:
# generate_large_report.delay(params_for_report)
```

**Running:**

1.  Start the message broker (e.g., Redis server).
2.  Start one or more Celery workers: `celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info`
3.  Your main application calls `.delay()` or `.apply_async()` on the task functions to queue them.
