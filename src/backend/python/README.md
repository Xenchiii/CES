# Python Backend Services

This directory contains placeholder code for Python-based backend services planned for the ICCT CES website. These services are intended to run separately from the Next.js frontend and communicate via APIs.

## Services

1.  **Data Analysis & Reporting (`data_analysis/`)**
    *   Purpose: Analyze user activity, generate reports, and potentially power personalized recommendations.
    *   Technology: Flask/Django, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations).
    *   Implementation: Develop API endpoints that the Next.js app (specifically the Admin dashboard) can call to fetch reports or trigger analysis tasks. Data would likely come from the main application database (MySQL).

2.  **AI Tutoring API (`ai_tutoring/`)**
    *   Purpose: Provide AI-powered tutoring capabilities, potentially integrating with external AI models or custom logic.
    *   Technology: Flask/Django, potentially libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or interfaces to external AI services.
    *   Implementation: Create endpoints that Sparrow AI (via Genkit tools) or a dedicated frontend component can call with student questions. The API processes the question and returns an AI-generated explanation or guidance.

3.  **Background Task Processing (`background_tasks/`)**
    *   Purpose: Handle long-running or resource-intensive tasks like bulk email sending, large report generation, or complex data processing without blocking the main web application.
    *   Technology: Celery, RQ (Redis Queue), Dramatiq with a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ.
    *   Implementation: Define tasks that can be queued by the Next.js app or other backend services. Worker processes consume tasks from the queue and execute them asynchronously.

4.  **Hardware Interaction API (`hardware_interaction/`)** (Optional)
    *   Purpose: If sub-organizations like GHZ Builders need to interact with specific hardware (sensors, microcontrollers) connected to a server.
    *   Technology: Flask/Django, libraries like `pyserial`, `RPi.GPIO` (if using Raspberry Pi).
    *   Implementation: API endpoints that allow authorized users or systems to send commands to or receive data from connected hardware. Requires careful security considerations.

## Running These Services

Each service (Flask/Django app) needs to be run independently. This typically involves:
1.  Setting up a Python environment (`venv` or `conda`).
2.  Installing dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3.  Running the server (e.g., `flask run` or `python manage.py runserver`).
4.  Ensuring the Next.js application can reach the API endpoints (CORS configuration might be needed).

**Note:** The code provided in these directories are basic placeholders and require significant development to become functional APIs.
